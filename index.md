excerpt: "Part of the 20th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems"
intro: 
  - excerpt: 'The workshop aims to discuss applications of agent technologies to healthcare, a crucial domain of research, as demonstrated by the numerous initiatives devoted to financially supporting projects in this topic, such as those included under the “Health and Wellbeing” work programme of H2020 in Europe or promoted by the NIH in the USA.
They particularly motivate research devoted to finding solutions enabling an effective introduction of ICT in healthcare, as it is expected to have a big impact in expanding healthcare coverage while reducing its costs.
Topics like Healthy Ageing, Active Living, Chronic Disease Management, Patient Empowerment or others related to Quality of Life play an increasingly important role in this research.'
