Intelligent agent-based systems constitute one of the most exciting research areas in Artificial Intelligence.
Due to the growing interest in the application of agent-based systems in healthcare, a number of applications addressing clinical problems are already based on agent technology.
Thus, it is unquestionable that a benefit is guaranteed if the specialists in the field can meet and report on the results achieved in this area, discuss the advantages that agent-based systems may bring to medical domains, and possibly the problems they encountered, and also provide a list of the research topics that should be tackled in the near future.

Core aspects of this workshop will be:
 - **Interdisciplinary research**: special efforts will be devoted to attract the attention of healthcare and biomedical specialists, so that they attend the workshop and realise the potential benefits of agent technology;
 - **Applied research**: the organising committee will also pay special attention to papers describing applications which are not just academic, but that are already deployed and running in a real medical environment;
 - Research devoted to **integrating agents with other technologies from the broad AI domain** will be particularly welcome, such as machine learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, distributed planning.

## Topics of interest

 - Agent-based methods for medical image segmentation or classification
 - Agent-based decision support systems for disease diagnosis
