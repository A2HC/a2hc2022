## Online organisation

Due to the ongoing global COVID-19 situation, ~~in case~~ the whole AAMAS conference will be held online, the workshop will accordingly be **asynchronous and online**, which means that each person interprets the schedule in **their own time zone** and an appropriate platform for sharing presentations and engaging discussion will be setup and communicated to authors in due time.
The aim of such a schedule is:
 - to get a commitment to spend time watching talks
 - engaging with comments to create synchronisation within each timezone
 - allowing for some discussion and social interaction

For homogeneity with AAMAS, the **chosen platform is [Underline](https://underline.io)**: the link to the workshop sessions will be made available as soon as AAMAS setup is completed by AAMAS organisers.
Authors are expected to **regularly monitor** and respond to questions and comments on their presented paper.
All the interested people, authors of the workshop or not, may exploit the platform functionalities to query presenters about their talk, hence presenters (and other co-authors in general) **MUST COMMIT** to regularly monitor the platform and reply to comments as appropriate, as a form of social engagement.

Finally, **live Q&A sessions** with the authors of the workshop papers will be organised.
Organisers will then attend as moderators.
The schedule of this live Q&A sessions will be agreed upon case by case amongst the paper authors and the interested people.
