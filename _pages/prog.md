## Online organisation

Due to the ongoing global COVID-19 situation, ~~in case~~ the whole AAMAS conference will be held online, hence the workshop will accordingly be **asynchronous and online**, which means that each person interprets the schedule in **their own time zone** and an appropriate platform for sharing presentations and engaging discussion will be setup and communicated to authors in due time.
The aim of such a schedule is:
 - to get a commitment to spend time watching talks
 - engaging with comments to create synchronisation within each timezone
 - allowing for some discussion and social interaction

The [Underline.io](https://underline.io) platform used for AAMAS main conference *cannot be used a comprehensive platform for workshops too*, as video embeddings and Q&A chat are not available.
Hence, A2HC 2021 Committee chosen to deliver presentations and facilitate discussion in the following ways:
 - **this page** will be the reference for accessing talks, slides, discussions, anything related to the workshop
 - A2HC 2021 still has [its own page on Underline.io](https://underline.io/events/116/sessions?eventSessionId=3402), that reports the program schedule and the [Zoom](https://zoom.us) link to the Opening and Discussion Table sessions (see below)
 - talks will be pre-recorded, hosted on either [YouTube]() or [Vimeo](), and shared below in the "Schedule" section
 - slides will be hosted directly here or on Slideshare, and shared below in the "Schedule" section
 - a ["Social Table" Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hPYYY1hfUAgnzdhs_fifj3__YQOPklcshIRpJSCxw7Y/edit?usp=sharing) is made available to engage discussions asynchronously (exemplary Q&A are provided)

Authors are expected to **regularly monitor** and respond to questions and comments on their paper.
All workshop participants are welcome to join the discussion.
Presenters (and other co-authors in general) **MUST COMMIT** to regularly monitor the Social Table and reply to comments as appropriate, as a form of social engagement.

Finally, **live Q&A sessions** with the authors of the workshop papers will be organised on a per-need basis: please, contact A2HC 2021 organisers to setup a Q&A session.
At least one organiser will then setup the session and attend as moderator.
The schedule of this live Q&A sessions will be agreed upon case by case amongst the paper authors and the interested people.

## Schedule

The workshop will be held on **May, 4th 2021**, from **13:00 to 16:00 BST**, in an asynchronous way.
This means that the only livestreaming sessions will be the Opening and the Discussion Table, as pre schedule below.
All presentations will be pre-recorded.
