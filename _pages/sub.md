## Review process

All papers will be reviewed by at least three reviewers, in a **double-blind process**.
Papers will be selected based on their originality, relevance, technical clarity, and quality of presentation.

A typical scale of [-2, 2] will be used to score the papers, and only those with a positive average classification will be considered for presentation.
Furthermore, papers with at least one negative score will be further screened:
 - if the negative review is too low, the paper will be rejected
 - in case of a mild negative review, the paper will receive an additional fast-track review to determine if it can be considered for presentation
