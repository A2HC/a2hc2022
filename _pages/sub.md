Manuscripts should be submitted to EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=a2hc2021](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=a2hc2021).

Papers submitted to A2HC 2021 must describe original research results and must not have been published or simultaneously submitted anywhere else.
**At least one author** of each accepted paper must register for the A2HC 2021 and present the paper at the workshop (be it in presence or remotely).

## Publication venue

All accepted and presented papers will be published in a [**Topical Collection of the Journal of Medical Systems**](http://www.springer.com/journal/10916), Springer, I.F. 3.058.

For publication, it is **required** that authors carefully revise their manuscripts according to both the reviewers' comments received while submitting to the workshop, and the comments received from the audience during the workshop. 

## Formatting

Papers must respect the submission guidelines and template required for the publication in JOMS as available at:
[http://www.springer.com/journal/10916/submission-guidelines]().

## Review process

All papers will be reviewed by at least three reviewers, in a **double-blind process**.
Papers will be selected based on their originality, relevance, technical clarity, and quality of presentation.

A typical scale of [-2, 2] will be used to score the papers, and only those with a positive average classification will be considered for presentation.
Furthermore, papers with at least one negative score will be further screened:
 - if the negative review is too low, the paper will be rejected
 - in case of a mild negative review, the paper will receive an additional fast-track review to determine if it can be considered for presentation
